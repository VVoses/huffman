# Program for working with huffman-encoding and decoding in scheme.

##Generating a huffman tree
Make your own tree by declaring a list of tuples where the first element is the word, and the second element is the amount of times it appears in your text, and feeding the list into the "grow-huffman-tree procedure".

#Encoding a message
Encode a message using the "encode" procedure with your message as the first argument, and your tree as the second.

#Decoding a messages
Decode your bitstring using the "decode" procedure with your bits as the first argument, and your tree as the second.
